## A little coding

### Replit

Replit is a platform that allows you to write and run code in any language using AI, with a broad selection of templates

**Pros:** You can make any kind of project from bots to apps.
**Cons:** AI is not as great as GPT-4.

- Replit has templates for Streamlit apps, React apps, Telegram bots, Discord bots, Pygame, Phaser games. [Start here.](https://replit.com/)

### Coding

If you want to code an app yourself quickly, I'd probably start from a NextJS (JavaScript) or Streamlit (Python) template.

- For NextJS, here's a cool template that uses OpenAI you can use: [jamesmurdza/nextjs-postgres-openai-starter](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/nextjs-postgres-openai-starter)
- For AI app generation, if you want to generate just a nice looking frontend, use [GitWit](https://gitwit.dev/). If you want to generate a complete web app with a backend, try [Mage](https://usemage.ai/).
- For the next level, you might want an entire app with payments, email, etc. Here are a few great templates: [OpenSaaS](https://opensaas.sh/), [Cascade](https://cascade.stackonfire.com/), [Saasfly](https://show.saasfly.io/en)
